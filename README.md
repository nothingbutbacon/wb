## Getting Started

Ensure you have the latest Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.

Open up your terminal, navigate to the project location and run `python wb.py`

If it is your first time, you need to follow the prompt and authenticate yourself. You just need to do this once.

Once everything is set, the program should start a connection and listen to your orders, and print the details on any filled order to the terminal
